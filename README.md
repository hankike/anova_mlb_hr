# anova_mlb_hr
An ANOVA breakdown of all home runs hit in Major League Baseball.

# Data Used
Every home run hit in Major League Baseball is tracked by Baseball Savant. They track exit velocity, launch angle, hit distance, velocity of the pitch, the expected batting average, and the number of parks the ball would be a home run in. The point of this project is to see if we can notice differences through ANOVA in distance, exit veocity, and launch angle seperated by team or stadium the home run was hit in.
